## About me

Perfectionist and passionate freelancer frontend developer, willing to learn and make good user experience products. I can make a totally new production ready product from scratch with understanding about architecture from backend to frontend side. Beside from that, I am always seriously thinking about user experience and making better coding quality as well.
